# Gym Website

## Overview
This project is a website for F2 Fitness Center, designed to showcase the services, success stories, and contact information for the fitness center. It was created in 2021 to practice design creativity and backend skills, without a focus on making the site responsive.

## Features
- Home: Introduction and motivational message.
- About Us: Fitness centerâ€™s history and mission.
- Services: Information about different fitness services.
- Success Stories: Client testimonials.
- Contact Us: Contact details and Google map embed.
- User Account: Modals for login, signup, and password reset.


## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS (Bootstrap, custom styles)
- JavaScript
- Firebase (for user authentication and database)
- jQuery

## Current Limitations
- **Responsiveness**: The website was not originally designed to be responsive. It may not display properly on different screen sizes, especially mobile devices.
- **Design**: The design was created to practice web design skills and may not reflect modern design standards.
- **Backend**: The backend was also part of a practice exercise and may not follow best practices.

## Future Improvements
To make the website responsive and improve its overall design and functionality, the following steps are planned:
1. **Implement Media Queries**: Add CSS media queries to adjust the layout and styles for different screen sizes.
2. **Responsive Navigation**: Create a dropdown menu for navigation on smaller screens.
3. **Element Resizing**: Adjust the sizes of images, text, and other elements to be proportional on smaller devices.

## Getting Started
To view or modify the project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the current state of the website.
3. Modify `styleformini.css` to implement the planned improvements.
